Creating my second website after freeCodeCamp's basic course, CodePen mockups,
hundreds of hours of online tutorials and some consultations with friends that
are developers. My goal is to apply what I learned (HTML, CSS & SCSS, Emmet tool)
and practice some technologies with which I'm not as confident yet (JS, jQuery, Git).
